    "description": "My most recent (matrix-themed) full-stack project. Affectionately named 'Girl Math' because its original purpose was to save my poor girlfriend from using Excel. This app is designed to make monthly budget plans easy. Just add your monthly income, monthly costs, their term, and their initial start dates, and it will automatically calculate your monthly totals, future payment dates, and your left-over spending money. There's even a place to track debts, loans, and other things. It also feels great to use on mobile. Feel free to checkout the GitHub or a (frontend-only) demo!"

    "description": "Avatar Metal Works is a 100%-custom workflow and inventory management system for a metal fabrication company. The system allows employees to create and manage work orders, track inventory, and provides clear workflow for each item. It looks simple on the outside, but under the hood there's tons of nuance and calculation happening to make sure that the inventory is always up-to-date. At Vital Time Tech, I was the primary developer on this project. Learning GraphQL, Vite, and Zustand on the fly, I was able to not only deliver on features, but also customize them along the way to fit the client's needs."

Looking for a specific type of company or job? Don't worry, Jobly has a search bar for when you really wanna narrow things down. Building this website was a blast, and taught me a ton about how to structure a full-stack application."

And of course this is all automatically stored on the user's profile page. That way, you can brag about your first 10 followers like I did back in the MySpace days. Other features include a profile-edit page, an intelligently populated feed, and the ability to write posts yourself."
